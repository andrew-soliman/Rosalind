print(Hello World!)

I'm undertaking this independent project to enhance and refine my skills in coding and understanding of molecular biology using the education platform found at rosalind.info
Rosalind provides detailed explanations in certain areas of focus in biology (usually genomics) and provides problem sets based on these focuses that require coding knowledge to solve.

Started: Summer 2020
